ESP32 DLED Controller controls *WS2812B type* digital LEDs using the RMT peripheral of ESP32.

This implementation uses the RMT driver from `ESP-IDF` and uses one `RMT` channel 
for a LED strip **leaving the other channels free, under the control of the RMT driver**.
Here are some key points of this implementation:

- the control of the LEDs is separated from the control of the `RMT` peripheral;
- the other `RMT` channels can be used as needed;
- the `RMT` peripheral is used through `ESP-IDF`'s own driver.

Right now the negative point is that this code uses a lot of RAM, *because of the
way the driver and peripheral works*.
There is a way to add a hook in the driver's transmission code but considering the
multithreading architecture of FreeRTOS this may add jitter creating visual artifacts,
depending on application.

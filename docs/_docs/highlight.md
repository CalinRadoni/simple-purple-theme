# Syntax highlighting

`_highlight.scss` was generated with `rougify style github > _highlight.scss` but the
result was somehow disappointing.

I have heavily modified the file, is usable and I think is OK for all cases.

The tokens are generated by `kramdown`. Do NOT expect the same highlighting as in
GitHub because there are different tokens !

For further modifications keep in mind these links:

- GitHub's [light syntax highlight css](https://github.com/primer/github-syntax-light)
- some documentation about the tokens from [pygments](https://pygments.org/docs/tokens/)

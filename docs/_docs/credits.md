# Credits

I have learned a lot from:

* [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Webjeda Blog](https://blog.webjeda.com/)
* [Material Design](https://material.io/)
* [Intro to structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data)
* [JSON for Linking Data](https://json-ld.org/)
* [The Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/)

Icons are from the [Icons - Material Design](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) site.

Social share icons are SVG objects from [fontawesome-free-5.13.0-web](https://fontawesome.com/) sprites.
I have modified them to be able to apply the right brand colors (added white background and classes).
I have take the modification path for size, because Font Awesome is huge and I needed only 6 icons, no `js`, no `css`.
See Font Awesome's [free license](https://fontawesome.com/license/free).

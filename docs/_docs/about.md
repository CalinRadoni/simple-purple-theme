# About

This is a [Jekyll gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes) built to be 100%
compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It was created for [calinradoni.github.io](https://calinradoni.github.io/).

I wanted a simple, Javascript free theme.

In the beginning I have used a custom html template and css - how hard could that be ?
When I needed more features I decided to read about Jekyll.

I have tested a few themes, nice or ugly, simple to use or with a step learning
curve, with one or one hundred features, with or without Javascript, with local only or GitHub Pages building.

Well, I had the crazy idea to build mine, *tailor made*, how hard could that be ?
How many hours will it takes ? 8, 24, 80 ?

More then 80 hours later ... the version 1.0.0 is out and I like it.
